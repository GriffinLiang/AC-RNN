# AC-RNN

AC-RNN is a framework to learn the representation of multi-attribute conjunction. The code is provided for reproducing the results of our  ECML2016 submission. The data is also included in this repository by using [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/). You can download and install LFS within only three steps to acquire the data.

* This package depends on Mark Schmidt's freely available minFunc optimization package [link](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc/minFunc.html).
